[Try it](https://race.onurakcay.dev/)


A comprehensive horse racing simulation application built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vuex. Features 6 rounds of racing with 20 unique horses, complete with animations, mobile responsiveness, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- **6-Round Racing System**: Different distances from 1200m to 2200m
- **20 Unique Horses**: Each with distinct names, colors, and conditions
- **Real-time Race Animation**: Smooth horse movement with live tracking
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Floating Action Buttons**: Mobile-specific navigation
- **Bottom Sheet Components**: Mobile-friendly content display
- **Complete Program & Results**: Track all races and standings
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests and E2E test coverage

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
